#### Setting up Monkapps reverse tunnel for local dev
* https://wiki.mediamonks.net/Monkapps2
* See "Public URL for local machine"
* Skip step 5, dev-server.js takes care of this

#### Sync Dialogflow agent
In order to use the syncing tools, there should be a key-file with credentials for the project you want to interact with in the `tools/sync/keys` folder. Note that you can have more than one file (for multiple projects).

After that, you can run the sync script like so:
```sh
npm run sync PROJECT-ID OPERATION [RESTORE-FILE]
```
The `PROJECT-ID` is used to look up the correct key-file, and `OPERATION` can be one of the following:
  
 * __down__: writes the remote project to local json files into `config/dialogflow-agent` (and runs validate command when done)
 * __up__: pushes local json files to remote
 * __compare__: shows differences between local & remote
 * __validate__: gives some reports on the local files
 * __export__: exports the project to a zip file
 * __restore__: restores the project from a zip file (3rd argument)

#### Set up Google security for using the Simulator
* Go to https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols
* Enable Web & App Activity, Device Information, and Voice & Audio Activity
